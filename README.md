After the code is written, it is translated by a Java compiler into bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The bytecode is usually stored in files with the ".class" extension. These class files are loaded and executed by the JVM at runtime.

When you build a Java application or program, the typical approach is to write and edit the source code in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans. The IDE provides tools for checking and correcting syntax errors and managing project files and libraries.

After the code is written in the IDE, it can be compiled and executed. The output of the application can either be output to the console or saved to files, depending on the use case and requirements.
